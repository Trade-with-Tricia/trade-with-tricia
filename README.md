This is the repository for Trade with Tricia's chatbot built using the Amazon Lex framework.
The project uses the Amazon Lex Java SDK to make API calls to the appropriate methods needed
to build the different pieces of the bot. The Amazon Java SDK is brought in through Maven dependencies.


To add functionality to the chatbot, branch off develop, add in your functionality and you can just
run the project to see the changes reflected on the console. If everything looks good, raise a PR into develop.
